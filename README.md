# 🧭 LszPy: Scripts for Gravity and Magnetic Field Analysis & Modelling

> 🚧 **Project Status:** This project is currently under active development. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## 📖 Description

This repository collects a set of Python scripts developed for processing, analysing, and modelling gravity and magnetic field data. These tools are designed to support both research activities and practical applications, including Bouguer anomaly corrections, geophysical data interpolation, density or susceptibility forward/inverse modelling, and results visualisation.

## 🚀 Main Features

- Calculation of gravity corrections (free-air, Bouguer, topographic)
- Processing of magnetic data (IGRF, leveling, RTP)
- Analysis and filtering of potential field data
- Generation of anomaly maps
- Forward modelling of gravity data (Prisms, Polyhedrons, FFT)

## 🎯 Who it’s for

Geologists, geophysicists, students, or anyone interested in learning and experimenting with potential field data processing, using clear, customisable, and extensible code.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lszpy.git

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

To install all required Python modules with Conda:

- On **Linux/macOS**, run:
  ```bash
  bash install_modules.sh

- On **Windows**, run:
   ```bash
install_modules.bat
